(A) Water Fall Model will be used here because in the data processing project all the data are predefined.

(B) Prototype Model will be used here because the End user(User-Centric) Approach is used here.

(C) Water Fall Model wil be used here because new feature is build upon existing feature and it conveys about the use of bassic feature.

(D) Incremental Model is used here because of availability of team and evolutionary incremental because requirements are changing fast.

(E) Website is for online store it can use waterfall model but it need changes accordingly so iterative.

(F) Spiral Model is used because it invlove risk factor.

(G) Incremental Model is used here because requirements are understood and are knownn up-front.

(H) Waterfall Model is used here because the data and requirements are known,clear and fixed.

(I) Prototyping because end-user will be focussed here / also incremental.

(J) Spiral Model is used here because it involve risk factor.

(K) Evolutionary Incremental.

(L) Spiral Model is used here because it invole risk factor. From the doctor's point of view it can involve prototype model also because 
    doctor operates also.

(M) Water Fall Model because changes are not required.
